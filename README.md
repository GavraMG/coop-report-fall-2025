About My Project
This repository hosts the Co-op Work Term Report for my Fall 2025 placement at Brock Solutions, where I worked as a Desktop Support Specialist.

Designed to meet the "Outstanding" grading criteria for the Bachelor of Computing program, this report is a single-page, responsive website that serves as a portfolio of my capabilities and experiences. Instead of a traditional document, this website utilizes modern web design to reflect on my learning goals, the technical challenges I solved (such as VM Infrastructure management), and the professional growth I achieved during the term.

🚀 Features
Responsive Design: A fully fluid layout that adapts seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

Custom Visual Styling: Features a unique "Circle Design" visual transition and utilizes the Unbounded font family for a modern, industrial aesthetic.

Interactive Elements: Includes hover effects on "Learning Goal" cards using CSS transitions and glowing animations.

Single-Page Navigation: Smooth-scrolling navigation that links directly to specific sections (Intro, Employer, Experience, Goals) without reloading the page.

Optimized Accessibility: High-contrast text and clean HTML structure to ensure readability.

No Login Required: Publicly accessible portfolio as per the Co-op Work Term Report guidelines.

💻 Tech Used
This website uses:

HTML5: Semantic markup structure for the report content.

CSS3: Advanced styling including Flexbox, CSS Grid, media queries, and absolute positioning for the background art.

Google Fonts: Integration of the Unbounded font family for typography.

Ionicons: A library used for the icons in the "Learning Goals" section.

GitHub Pages: (Optional) Used for hosting the live version of the report.
