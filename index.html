            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my Fall 2025 work term report. From September to December, I worked as a <strong>Desktop Support Specialist</strong> at <strong>Brock Solutions</strong>. This role was about more than just closing support tickets; it gave me a real look at the IT systems that keep a global engineering firm running.</p>
            
            <p>Over these four months, I handled a fast-paced workload which went from managing important Virtual Machine (VM) updates to making sure new hires had a smooth start on their first day. My goal with this website is to show you how I applied my school knowledge to real-world tasks, demonstrating that good IT support requires both technical skills and flexibility.</p>

        <section id="employer" class="report-section">
            <h2>About The Employer</h2>
            <p><strong>Brock Solutions</strong> is the engineering power behind many systems you probably use without realizing it. In fact, if you have checked a bag at airports like <strong>Toronto Pearson</strong>, you have likely relied on their technology. They build the automation software and controls that sort and route luggage to the correct flight at airports around the world.</p>
            
            <p>Beyond airports, they also automate factory production lines and transportation networks. Because they build such critical, real-time systems, their own internal technology needs to be flawless. The company relies on a strong IT team to keep their engineers connected and working efficiently across the globe.</p>

            <h2>Job Description & Projects</h2>
            <p>As a <strong>Desktop Support Specialist</strong> (Sept 2 - Dec 15, 2025), I was the "go-to" person whenever technology stopped working. My main responsibility was to keep the office running smoothly by solving technical problems as soon as they appeared.</p>
            
            <ul class="report-list">
                <li><strong>The Global Ticket Queue:</strong> I managed the daily flow of support requests on a worldwide scale. I diagnosed and fixed technical issues for colleagues not just locally, but also for teams working in the US, England, and Australia.</li>
                <li><strong>New Hire Setup:</strong> I was responsible for the "Day One" experience. I configured laptops and accounts so that new employees could sit down and start working immediately without technical delays.</li>
                <li><strong>Device Refreshes:</strong> I managed the upgrade cycle for employees with aging computers. I replaced old laptops with new models, carefully transferring data and settings to ensure staff could switch devices without losing any work.</li>
                <li><strong>Event Support:</strong> I handled the tech for big company-wide meetings to ensure the audio and video connected smoothly for everyone.</li>
                <li><strong>Asset Management:</strong> I kept track of the company’s physical equipment, running audits to make sure we knew exactly what devices we had and where they were located.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="project-highlight">
                <h3>Featured Project: VM Infrastructure Optimization</h3>
                <p>My most significant technical contribution was taking full ownership of the company’s Virtual Machine (VM) testing farm. This infrastructure is the backbone of the engineering department, allowing developers to simulate complex client environments without needing physical hardware.</p>
                <p>I executed a rigorous maintenance schedule, deploying critical Windows security updates and configuring specialized automation software across multiple instances. By proactively resolving update conflicts and ensuring environment consistency, I minimized downtime and guaranteed that the engineering team always had a stable, secure platform for their critical testing.</p>

                    <h3>Technical Mastery</h3>
                    <p>I aimed to master VM management and hardware deployment. I successfully met this goal by taking ownership of the testing farm updates and learning enterprise-level troubleshooting.</p>

                    <h3>Professional Growth</h3>
                    <p>I focused on improving response times and balancing long-term projects with immediate support requests. This taught me critical time-management skills in a corporate setting.</p>

                    <h3>Global Communication</h3>
                    <p>My objective was to support a diverse international user base. By assisting teams in the US, UK, and Australia, I learned to explain complex technical issues clearly across different cultures and time zones.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>My work term at Brock Solutions was a pivotal step in my career, transforming me from a student into a capable IT professional. This experience was a masterclass in adaptability; whether I was troubleshooting for a colleague in Australia or deploying critical updates to the VM farm, I learned that technical proficiency must be paired with clear communication to be effective.</p>
            
            <p>I am leaving this role with a deep understanding of enterprise-level infrastructure and the confidence to manage high-stakes technical environments. If there is one takeaway from this portfolio, it is that I am no longer just learning how systems work—I am now capable of keeping them running.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Acknowledgments:</strong> I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the entire IT department at Brock Solutions. Thank you for trusting me with your critical infrastructure, for your patience during my training, and for the mentorship that guided my growth throughout the term.</p>
